    <h2>About me </h2> 
    <p class="lede">I like to work with people who care about user centred, inclusive design.</h2>
    <p>I have a passion for accessibility and designing for everyone no matter what their ability.</p> 

    <p>Most recently I've become a product owner for a design system, specialising in design team processes, community building, and my passion lies with user centred design. To set a baseline for the health of our components I'm leading an accessibility-led health check. Everything we do is rooted in WCAG 2.1 (to be 2.2) standards.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
