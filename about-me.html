  <p class="lede">Hi, my name is Karl Goldstraw. I’m a senior interaction / UX designer based near London UK with a passion for accessibility and user centred design.</p>

  <p>I currently work for <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk">NHS Digital</a>, as a Senior Interaction Designer, which actually spans service design, research, front end and content. I’m happy enough facilitating workshops including <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/">design sprints</a>, working with user researchers and building prototypes in HTML and CSS. I'm comfortable working in an agile environment.</p>

  <p>I have a particular interest in accessibility, and I’ve done multiple in-house audits for teams over the years. I enjoy advocating best practice as well as finding new ways to help others build empathy. I’m an avid member of our ability network and accessibility working group.</p>
