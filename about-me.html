  <p class="lede">Hi, my name is Karl Goldstraw. I'm a senior product designer and design system lead with a passion for accessibility and user centred design.</p>

  <p>I like to work with people who care about accessibility and inclusive design. I have a passion for designing for everyone, no matter their ability.</p>

  <p>I'm an avid member of our ability network and accessibility working group as well as a volunteer for a charity who help people living with visual impairment.</p>
