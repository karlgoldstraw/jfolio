title: Designing Responsive and Accessible Tables
---

<section>
  <p>Tables can be a pain to display especially on smaller screens.</p>

  <p>I've seen tables treated very differently across the web. Either they get squashed into the viewport, or they are fixed-width and require a user to know to scroll across horizontally. Users tend to not like scrolling, especially horizontally.</p>

  <p>Examples or tables:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/table/">GOV.uk tables</a> are fixed width and currently require users to scroll</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/deals/deals-hunter/2018/12/nandos-moneysaving-hacks/">MoneySavingExpert.com</a> does the same, but offers some affordance in the form of little left and right arrows.</li>
    <li>Whilst many other sites simply <br>
    create <br>
    many <br>
    line- <br>
    breaks <br>
    in a <br>
    column <br>
    to fit <br>
    content in.</li>
  </ul></p>

{% include image.html
  desktop="assets/img/Desktop-table1.jpg"
  mobile="assets/img/Mobile-table1.jpg"
  alt="A screenshot of a table with 4 rows and 4 columns. The forth column is visually cut off the endge of the screen."
  caption="MoneySavingExpert.com uses affordance to tell users to scroll horizontally"
