title: A colourful language for our team
---

<section>
  <p>I love Zeplin, it’s the bridge that keeps our designers and developers communicating as the team we should be. Having a colour palette of 4 base colours, and 6 extended colours with % tints for opacity, was never going to be easy to work with for a developer that just want to use primary colours because they don’t have time for pretty things.</p>

  <p>As a designer I like to use a variety of colours and tints, but as a developer I know it’s horrible having lots of different names for these colours. And it’s even worse communicating that you’d like to swap out Red for Red-lighter-light.</p>

  <p>This is how a Sass file of colour references can easily start to look:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>$Red: #E32222;</li>
    <li>$Red-light: #E94F4F;</li>
    <li>$Red-lighter: #F4AAAA;</li>
    <li>$Red-ligtest: #FAD7D7; /* Pink? */</li>
    <li>$Red-dark: #A41515;</li>
    <li>$Red-darkest: #600C0A;</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Code and communication quickly it becomes a mess, and when discussing verbally, nobody really knows which colour you’re talking about, right?</p>
