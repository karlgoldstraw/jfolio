title: Dealing with long H1's
---

<section>
  <p>On nhs.uk we had some really long clinical words, words that are kind of important to display correctly.</p>

  <p>But we also have users who have some really small screens. (Over 100 million session per year are at 375px and less).</p>

  <p>Whilst we needed a minimum font-size for legibility on small screens, the same font-size didn't always show all of the characters in a 20 letter condition across a 320px mobile screen, especially when it was a H1 title.</p>

  <p>Some examples that didn't fit a mobile screen width were:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Electroencephalogram (20 letters)</li>
    <li>Hyperparathyroidism (19 letters)</li>
    <li>Cholangiocarcinoma (18 letters)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The image above shows just how even this 17 word condition wouldn't fit onto the given styles. And yet we had to find a way to accomodate over 4,380 H1's with the same design at scale.</p>
