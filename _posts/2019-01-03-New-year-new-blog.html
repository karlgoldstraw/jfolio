  <p>At the end of last year I promised myself that I'd create a place that I could keep all the snippets of knowledge that I accumulate. I do write some things down, but never in a single place. And I tend to rely on things being 'in my mind' which to be honest never really works out in the long term.</p>

  <p>Today I asked the question on Twitter about whether I was doing the right thing putting an unfinished blog live, rather than using my <a href="https://medium.com/@karlgoldstraw">Medium account</a> or another publishing platform like LinkedIn. I like likes and claps, but I don't do it for that reason.</p>

  <div class="inset-text">
    <p>Depends where you see the value. If you saw the value in writing you could have just shared an open Google Doc or Evernote note or some such. <a href="https://twitter.com/ermlikeyeah/status/1080884392233500673">Simon Wilson</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>It's a really good point, for me I've never been <em>that</em> good at simply writing things in an engaging way. I certainly don't see myself as the next <a href="http://www.redjotter.com/redjotterblog/">Redjotter</a>.</p>

  <p>I've decided to build my own blog for multiple reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>This is a Jekyll blog running on Github pages. Building my own thing has allowed me to learn Jekyll from the ground up, and coupled with SCSS and Livereload has given me a really solid workflow.</li>
    <li>My front page uses CSS grid. I've been watching lots of <a href="http://jensimmons.com">Jen Simmons</a> videos over the holidays on the subject.</li>
    <li>I installed the latest version of <a href="https://emmet.io">Emmet</a>. I love Emmet â€“ it allows me to write blog posts quickly, because, whilst I see some value in Markdown for content editors and those not familiar with code, as a designer I want full HTML flexibility but at the writing pace that Markdown provides.</li>
    <li>I'm constantly testing this site with VoiceOver on iOS and NVDA on Windows to build and learn with accessibility best practices. As a designer, I've always found that having a portfolio/playground website is a perfect way to test out the things you can't always do at work.</li>
    <li>I've nicked some design thinking and code from <a href="https://twitter.com/heydonworks">Heydon Pickering</a> and also my superb colleagues working on the brilliant <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend">NHS front end library</a>. Being able to put into practice lessons from others in a way that makes sense to you at your own pace can help build knowledge in a way that you'll learn and remember. Mistakes that don't hurt anyone are the best ones to learn from.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So, onwards. Lots to do, lots to learn and lots to record. I will keep my posts short and sweet and you never know, I might even start spelling things correctly.</p>
